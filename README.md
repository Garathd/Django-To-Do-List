# Trackx

This project was inspired by the constant paper To Do lists that I seem to have lying around the house. I thought it might be good to create something that can categorize various tasks and projects to make my workflow more efficient. Tasks have status's and and priority to help figure out which task is the most important

## UX Design

My UX process was to analyze what I thought would streamline my original paper to do list and try to develop this into a user friendly website that is easy to navigate

The requirements are:

- To be able to to create, edit and delete a project
- To be able to create, edit and delete a task
- To be able to assign a projects type as Work, Educational or Personal
- To be able to search  projects by Work, Educational or Personal
- To be able to view only the tasks for a specific project
- To be able to search tasks by High, Medium or Low Priority as well as To Do, In Progress and Done(Not sure about Done just yet)
- To be able to assign a project a Job, A Status and a Priority

User stories:

- As a user I want to be able to create edit and delete projects and tasks
- As a user I want to be able to filter projects by Work, Educational or Personal
- As a user I want to be able to filter tasks by Priorities and Status

## Design

### Front-End

### Back-End

For local testing i'm using sqlite and for live version I'm using Postgre SQL as an add with Heroku
Not to sure what else to add here for now


## Features

## Features Left to Implement and Future Features

At the moment this application only caters to myself as the nature of this project is essentially a task and project management system that is for me to keep track on what I need to do. 

In the future I hope to have additional users that can be setup to different projects as groups of users.

Also a feature I just thought of could be good maybe upload a screenshot for a task and install pillow

## Technologies Used

### Python and Django

Django is the Python Framework Iâ€™m using for this application

### CSS

Im using Bootstrap for my CSS but i'm thinking I should look more into using Materialize in conjunction with Bootstrap 4

### JQuery

Using Minimal at the moment should really style this up a bit better

### Gulp

Will be using this to convert SCSS to CSS

## Testing

### Manual Testing

For manual testing I have tested on the following browsers. *Firefox*, *Chrome*, *Edge* and *IE11*. I had to add some css fixes for both Microsoft Browsers.

I used an Alcatel U5 for mobile phone resolution testing and a Dell Inspiron 5567 for all other testing.

After running each possible scenario multiple times, going over each feature, user stories and client requirements I then validated my HTML and CSS using the following:

- [HTML Validation](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html)
- [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)


## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment Steps

DEFAULT STEPS: NEED TO CHANGE THIS AND EXPAND AND MENTION MANUAL DEPLOYMENT FOR LIVE SITE!!!!!!!!

1. Go to the Heroku Website and create new app
2. Create requirements.txt and Procfile to tell heroku what is required to run the app
3. Login into Heroku Account via command line and add the newly created app
4. Go back to Heroku Website and in the settings tab click *Reveal Config Vars* and add IP and PORT vars from Project Config
5. Install [ClearDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cleardb) and import local MySQL Database dump.sql
5. Restart all dynos
6. Finally do an initial git commit and push to heroku
